Connected Vehicle DSRC Message Parser (DMP)
Version 1.1.0

Description:
The Data Processing Application (DPA) is a tool designed to make it easier to work with network packet capture (PCAP) files containing dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) data from connected vehicle (CV) applications. To facilitate this end, the DPA converts PCAP files containing binary encoded DSRC messages such as Basic Safety Messages (BSM), Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) messages, and Geographic Intersection Description (GID/MAP) messages, into a more human (and machine) readable format known as comma separate values (CSV). These CSV files can be opened by many programs such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Notepad as they are simply text files that adhere to the CSV specified format.


Installation and removal instructions:
The DMP depends on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or higher. The JRE is available from Oracle’s website at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html. Find the version of the JRE appropriate for your operating system (DMP is designed for Windows 7 64 bit) and download and install it. All the other dependencies of the DMP are bundled inside the application’s Java Archive (JAR) file.

The DPA can be installed in any folder that the user has permission to write to. The application is installed by opening the distribution zip file and extracting the JAR into the desired folder.
